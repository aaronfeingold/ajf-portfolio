# About Me

I'm Aaron: a technical founder in New Orleans, with a background in hospitality.

As a sommelier, sales rep, and software engineer, I have focused my skills on solving the problems of the restaurant industry.

And so currently, I am building Vino Vibes: providing your best life with big, easy wine experiences.

Yet beyond that, I work with small startups to ship 0â†’1 as a GTM software developer, specializing in cost and usage observability.

## Technical Foundation

**Highlights**: TypeScript, Next.js Python, FastAPI, SQL, and AWS.

**Notes**: Cloud native applications, data pipelines, and API integrations.

## Professional Goals

Taking shape now, I'm expanding my technical services to include business workflow automation and advanced knowledge management systems, supporting marketing and advertising.

I look for opportunities to make an fast paced impact in a validated problem, laying the groundwork for product growth.
