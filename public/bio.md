# About Me

I'm Aaron, a software engineer in New Orleans who builds 0â†’1 products that solve real business problems.

I specialize in rapid product development - taking concepts from idea to live product in weeks, not months. My focus is helping early-stage startups and companies ship their first versions fast, with clean architecture that scales.

Currently, I work with startups as a go-to-market software developer, building MVPs and focusing on cost/usage observability to help them grow efficiently.

## Technical Stack
TypeScript, Next.js, Python, FastAPI, SQL, AWS - deployment of cloud-native applications and data pipelines.

## What I Bring
I combine technical execution with business instincts developed through hospitality and sales experience. This background taught me to understand customer needs deeply and deliver solutions that actually work in practice.

## Current Focus
Seeking a software engineer role where I can apply my full-stack expertise to help innovate and deliver.
