    "bio": "My greatest passion and the thing I am best at is: playing guitar. Second to that is learning all about how great wine is made. Most of my free time is spent rock climbing, trail running, cooking elaborate dishes, meditating, and reading sci-fi. I've always wanted to create some large body of work that contributes to our understanding of human perception. When I began developing software, I found that it held more instruments for me to play with, opening new doors to possibilities of what I may create. Its my philosophy that the best software will help us to put down devices, and be able to step away from keyboards to experience the world",
